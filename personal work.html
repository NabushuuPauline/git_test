        <h2>His love is never ending</h2>
        <p>Once you get to know God personally, you begin to truly live.
           No one can love God or worship  God on your behalf,they can pray
           for you but at the end of the day you need to also pray for yourself.
           There's a kind of joy and peace that surpasses human understanding, it
           can only come from the spirit of God.
           In the begining was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word was God.

            God's unconditional love

        <p>
            God meets you from whichever point you are, He wont ask about where you 
            have been or what took you so long, He marvels in the fact that you are there now,
            He marvel in your beauty, your scars, your uniqueness and just ny looking at you
            He knows exactly how to love and heal you.
